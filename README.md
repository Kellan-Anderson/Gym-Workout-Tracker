# Gym Tracker App

[ðŸ”— Check out the deployed app](https://gym-workout-tracker-pi.vercel.app/). 

## The problem
When I go to the gym, I use Google sheets to keep track of my workouts. This works, but I have to keep updating the sheets every time I want to add a new workout. There are apps for this, but I want to try to make my own.

## The solution
I want to make a web app to use at the gym to keep track of my progress. This way, I can view stats about my workouts quickly from both my phone and my computer.

## Requirements
* User should see a home page asking them to sign in when first visiting the site. If the user is already signed in, they should be taken to a dashboard page.
* There should be a page where a user can manage the exercises that belong to them.
* There should be a page where a user can manage different workouts.
* There should be a page/section where a user can start and finish a workout. This screen should keep track of progress of the workout, such as what exercise they are are doing, how many reps they have left, and how many sets they have left.
* If a user leaves the workout, they should be able to come back and continue it.
* Workouts should be easy to track for cardio based exercises, such as running, cycling, and swimming.
